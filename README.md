## Overview
This is a neural network wirtten entirely in java to recognize hand written characters from the MNIST dataset. It is designed to make configurable neural networks with different activation functions and hidden layer structures. 


## Motivatioin
I wrote this as a challenge for myself and an exercise to learn more about neural networks. Additionally at the time I had just taken classes in vector calculus and linear algebra and this seemed like a neat application of what I learned. 


## Instructions 
Mnist.java trains a new neural netowrk and saves it as network.idx 

MnistTest.java runs the network saved as test_network.idx
