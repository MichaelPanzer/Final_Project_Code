## Overview
This project implements a neural network in Java designed to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The network can be configured with various activation functions and hidden layer structures, allowing for flexibility in model design.


## Motivation
The idea for this project came after taking classes in vector calculus and linear algebra. I wanted to apply what I learned and challenge myself by building a neural network from the ground up, using as little existing code as possible. 


## Instructions 
1. Compile the code
 ```bash
  javac *.java
```
2. Run MnistTest.java to run the existing network saved as test_network.idx
```bash
  java MnistTest
```

3. Run Mnist.java to train a new neural network and save it as network.idx
```bash
  java Mnist
```
